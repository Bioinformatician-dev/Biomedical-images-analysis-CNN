# Biomedical-images-analysis-CNN
Detecting cancer from biomedical images typically involves using machine learning or deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Instruction
Prepare Dataset: Organize your images into a directory structure like:
```bash
 data/
    train/
        cancer/
            image1.jpg
            image2.jpg
        no_cancer/
            image1.jpg
            image2.jpg
    validation/
        cancer/
        no_cancer/
```
## Install Required Libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
## Run the Code: 

Save the script as cancer_detect.py and execute it:

```bash
python cancer_detect.py
```
